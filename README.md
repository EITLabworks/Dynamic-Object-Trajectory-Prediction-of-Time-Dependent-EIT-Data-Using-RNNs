# Dynamic-object-trajectory-prediction-of-time-dependent-EIT-data-using-recurrent-neural-networks

This project presents a novel approach for dynamic image reconstruction of Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT). This approach uses a data-driven reconstruction model consisting of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and a mapper with an integrated Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) unit. The network has been specically designed for dynamic object trajectory prediction, allowing accurate tracking of an object's movement within the EIT tank and also predicting future object positions by exploiting temporal information in sequential EIT data. This approach was developed in both (2D and 3D) reconstructions of object motion. Data collection was performed using an EIT tank equipped with two electrode rings (each with 32 electrodes) and a Sciospec EIT device. In this project, the reconstruction network was trained and tested on synthetic data generated by FEM simulation (using pyEIT forward solver), experimental EIT data collected during 2D motion and experimental EIT data collected during 3D motion.

## Reconstruction network architecture

The architecture of the reconstruction model is based on two core components: a mapper with an integrated LSTM-layer at the output and a VAE decoder. The architectural design of the model is shown in figure...

The lstm mapper $\Xi$ processes temporal sequences of voltage measurements and maps it to the latent space h.
The VAE decoder $\Psi$ reconstructs the latent representation generated by the lstm mapper into a conductivity distribution.

The complete reconstruction network $\Gamma$ results from the concatenation of the individual mapping processes:
$\Gamma := \Xi \circ \Psi : \mathbf{V}_t \mapsto \mathbf{h}_{t+1} \mapsto \hat{\gamma}_{t+1}$

where $\mathbf{V}_t$ represents the voltage measurements at time $t$, $\mathbf{h}_{t+1}$ is the predicted latent space representation for time $t+1$, and $\hat{\gamma}_{t+1}$ is the reconstructed conductivity distribution for time $t+1$.
